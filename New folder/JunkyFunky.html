			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Junky Funky is an online store that sells unique and funky items, from vintage clothing to handmade accessories. We believe that everyone should have a little bit of funk in their lives. 
				<p>Junky Funky was founded in 1923 from my great grandfather, Junk Grandfunk. He had talents in making quite dangerous, vintage furniture and tools. His food supply were always plentiful! 
					Some of the foods he ate and died are on the shelves of our stores right now! We hope you can have the Funk of your lives! 

					Yours truly, JumboShelf01
